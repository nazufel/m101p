## Methods

### Mongodb Restore

1. Pulled down ```creating_documents.zip``` file, moved it to the ```migrations``` directory, unzipped it, and ran ```mongorestore dump/``` from the directory. This imported the video.moviesDetails database and collection.
* This query ```db.movieDetails.find({'year': 2013, 'rated': 'PG-13', 'awards.wins': 0}, {'title': 1, 'year': 1, 'rated': 1, 'awards': 1}).pretty()``` found the answer by searching for movies from the year 2013, rated PG-13, and with zero wins in the awards sub document. I also projected all the fields I searched for so that only those fields would be presented back to the cursor.
