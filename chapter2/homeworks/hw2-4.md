## Methods

### Mongodb Restore

1. I already had the db and collection running from hw2-4. I first ran the query ```db.movieDetails.find().pretty()``` and manually searched for the ```countries``` field to see how it as formatted.
* I then added the ```countries``` field and projection to my search. ```db.movieDetails.find({'countries': 'Sweden'}, {'countries': 1}).pretty()```
* This query ```db.movieDetails.find({'countries.1': 'Sweden'}, {'countries': 1}).count()
``` found the answer by searching for movies. ```{'countries.1': 'Sweden'}``` looked for entries where Sweden was second (starting at 0) in the list.
