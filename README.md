## Repo Organization

### Top Level
M101P: MongoDB for Developers course is seven weeks long with seven chapters. The top level of this repo is organized with directories that contain the particular week's work. Within each of those contains different files shown in the lessons for code copy for me to better understand Python.

### Chapters
The chapters directories have the code or handouts that were used in that chapter. Either the maintainer wrote the code while following the video examples or the code was provided.

#### Homeworks
The homeworks directory contains all the homework, either Python programs used to answer questions or markdown files detailing the queries used on MongoDB.

### Blog
The end project of this course is a fully functioning blog. There is a separate ```blog``` directory to contain all the code for the blog. If a homework question pertains to files within blog directory and are thus outside of the homework directory for that chapter, then a markdown file with specify.

### Migrations
Data consistency is crucial in any dev shop. This directory houses the dump directories and data generation scripts for MongoDB. All of these files were provided by MongoDB.
